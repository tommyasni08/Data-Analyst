# [Data Analyst] Traffic Congestion Analysis

Data Analysis Project
Analyze traffic congestion data for re route optimization, pricing optimization, ETA prediction, etc

## Description

Raw data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-traffic-congestions-2016-2022 for the analysis

Pre-process data work done:

1. Remove Invalid records
2. Convert datetime related columns
3. Calculate traffic congestion duration
4. Remove Invalid records (part 2)

Create data visualization using tableau [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tommy.asni/viz/USTrafficCongestionAnalysis/USTrafficCongestionAnalysis)

Consist of only 1 dashboard

- US Traffic Congestion Analysis (Quick intro, distance or duration parameter selection, US traffic congestion overview through map, traffic congestion over time and by state) Solving issue and finding opportunity like: Traffic congestion severity by time and states, measure ETA prediction accuracy with congestion, pricing algorithm in congestion scenario, etc.
